####zepto.js
Zepto is a light-weight library with a jQuery-compatilble API. In this project it is used only for DOM management and DOM event binding. 

####Gallery.js
This is the main controller that builds, reorders, and observes photo interactions.

####PhotoView.js
This is a class for all photo elements that handles html template rendering, drag behavior, etc. Animations are triggered here with CSS3.

####EventPublisher.js
This is a pub-sub helper that I have written and reused on various projects.
